Here's the README.md text for your PHP script:

# Visitor Information Logger

This PHP script logs visitor information, including IP address, User Agent, Request URI, and the timestamp of the visit. The data is stored in a text file named `visitor_info.txt`.

## How It Works

When a visitor accesses your website:

1. The script captures the following details:
   - **IP Address**: The IP address of the visitor.
   - **User Agent**: The browser and operating system information of the visitor.
   - **Request URI**: The URI accessed by the visitor.
   - **Timestamp**: The exact date and time of the visit.

2. The captured information is formatted into a log entry and appended to the `visitor_info.txt` file. If the file doesn't exist, it will be created automatically.

## Example Output

The `visitor_info.txt` file will contain entries like this:

```
IP Address: xxx.xx.xxx.xxx
User Agent: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64; rv:109.0) Gecko/20100101 Firefox/115.0
Request URI: /features/php-record-user-information/
Timestamp: 2024-08-22 10:23:54
```

## Usage

1. Place the PHP script on your server where you want to log visitor information.
2. When the script is executed, it will log the details of each visitor in the `visitor_info.txt` file located in the same directory as the script.

## Requirements

- PHP 5.0 or later

## Security Considerations

- Ensure that the `visitor_info.txt` file is not publicly accessible to prevent unauthorized access to visitor data.
- Consider limiting access to the script or using it in a controlled environment to protect the privacy of your visitors.
